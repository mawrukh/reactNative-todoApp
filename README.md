# reactNative-todoApp

## React Native Todo App
This is a simple Todo App built with React Native that allows users to add and delete todos. The app uses AsyncStorage to persist todos between sessions.

## Description:
In this project, we created a basic todo app in React Native with CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality. The app consists of two main sections: an input section and a list section.

In the input section, we added a label and a text input for the user to enter new todo items. We also added a button with a submit label to add the items to the list. When the user edits an existing todo item, the button label changes to "Update" instead of "Submit".

In the list section, we created a "My List" label and mapped over an array of todo items to display them as individual cards. Each card includes the todo item title, a delete button, and an edit button. When the user taps the edit button, the item's title appears in the text input in the input section for editing.

We also added some basic styles to make the app look nicer, including centering the label text, adding borderRadius to the button, and styling the todo item cards with a darker background color and white text color. We used the FontAwesome icon library to add icons to the delete and edit buttons.

Overall, this project provides a solid foundation for building a more complex todo app in React Native with additional features and functionality.
